# Raw Idea: Enhanced AI Model Integration

## User Description

Enhanced AI Model Integration — Implement multi-model ensemble with automatic performance-based model selection and cost optimization across Grok-4, Grok-3, and OpenAI models

## Initial Capture

The user wants to implement a sophisticated AI model integration system that can:
- Work with multiple AI models (Grok-4, Grok-3, OpenAI models)
- Automatically select the best performing model based on performance metrics
- Optimize costs by choosing the most cost-effective model for specific tasks
- Create an ensemble system that can combine models for better results
- Handle model fallbacks and redundancy

## Feature Context

This is the next priority feature in the product roadmap, marked as medium complexity `[M]`, and represents a significant enhancement to the AI trading bot's intelligence capabilities.

## Notes for Requirements Phase

- Need to understand current AI model usage in the codebase
- Must research performance metrics for different AI models
- Cost optimization strategies need investigation
- Ensemble implementation patterns need exploration
- Model selection algorithms require research
